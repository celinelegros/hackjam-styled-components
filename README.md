## How to use this repo

Each exercise will teach you about a concept of Styled Components in React. To jump from one exercise to another, edit `src/index.js` and change the path of the import of the `<App />` component.

##

### 1. Basics

The goal of this exercise to learn how to create Styled Components. 

If you take a look at the App Component you can see that it renders a ```section``` tag and this tag renders a ```h3```

##### First version
Create a StyledSection and a StyledTitle and use them in the App.js

##### Second version
Try to replicate the same app with only one Styled Component. You can target children from a Style Component to style them


### 2. Props

Since Styled Components are in fact React Components, you can modify the style based on props that you pass down.

### 3. Extend Style

In this exercise you can see that you have 3 inputs. All of the base input have the same style, and then some specific style is applied via classNames

The goal here is to create a "base" StyledInput, and then to create different Styled Components that extends the base style

### 4. Animations

### 5. Themes

### 6. Responsive

### 7. Final exercise

The final exercise is a mix of all the concepts that you have learned during this session!
